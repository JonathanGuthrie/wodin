done)  Finish the login code (so that it actually checks the password)

done)  Add case insensitivity where I've deferred it

done)  Add the AUTHENTICATE code

done)  Add the stubbed-out STARTTLS code

done)  Create the mailbox manipulation parts of an initial mailstore (mbox under
  unix)

done)  Un-comment the creation of the inbox

done) Make the mailbox error text come from the mailbox classes.  This will
  include having some sort of IMAP error code that indicates a mailbox error
  and some place to hold the mailbox error code

done)  Basic name space implementation

done)  Do the commands available in both the AUTHENTICATED and SELECTED state
  (NAMESPACE through SUBSCRIBE)
  done) namespace
  done) select and examine
  done) status
  done) append

done)  Do the commands available in the SELECTED state
  done) check
  done) close
  done) expunge
  done) search
  done) fetch
  done) store
  done) copy
  done) uid (three commands)

done)  Fix the fact that copying the torture test message to another mailbox
  corrupts it.  Two questions need answering:
    done)  Why does a copy cause the currently opened mailbox to be updated?
    done)  Why is part of the line copied over itself?
      NOTE:  These are two separate problems.  I can cause the corruption by causing the
             file to be rewritten by (for example) setting and then resetting a flag.

12)  Fix expunging the torture test from foo in the mbox mail store

13)  Figure out why I get the "INBOX already subscribed dialog" in Evolution

14)  Figure out why Evolution can't fetch the torture test

done)  Properly handle the situation where the IMAP-specific headers aren't in the messages of an mbox message base.

done)  Fix the case where I try a select before login and it crashes

17)  Refactor the utility message creation in MailstoreMbox

done)  Finish the parts of the NOOP command I've deferred

19)  Asynchonous notifications

done)  Fix the Support for mbox mailstores to add extra linefeeds before the "From " lines.

done)  Fix the "00000" in the time zone.

done)  Fix the "UNSEEN 1" display where there are no unseen messages.

23)  Fix the multiple simultaneous connection problem

24)  Fix the current memory leak

done)  Make sure that the MailStoreMbox (which is actually a driver for mboxrd)
   strips off the last line in the folder

done)  Make sure that the MailStoreMbox (which is actually a driver for mboxrd)
   appends a newline to every message.

27)  Move the body search and text search (largely) into the MailStore class.

)  Locking for multiple simultaneous access to mailboxes

)  LMTP support for local deliveries

)  Create a MailStoreMboxo mail store for compatability with Postfix

)  Set it up such that the SocketBindErrorException triggers retries instead of exiting with a failure
)  Better yet, figure out how to not have SocketBindErrorException

)  Restore the rest of the SASL authentication modes.  Include varying the CAPABILITY string if the user base has plaintext passwords or not.

)  Update the CAPABILITY code to handle the SASL authentication methods for
    those user bases for which plain text passwords are available

)  Test the SASL authentication modes

)  Overwrite the strings that hold passwords

)  Handle search charsets other than US-ASCII

)  Re-do the boyer-moore-pratt search so it's not downloaded code

)  Add anonymous authentication to the capability string (availability should be known by the server class--make that so as well)

)  Deal with logging

done)  Add an idle timer

)  Add support user-defined flags to the initial mailstore

done)  Add support for a delay after a failed login (need a timer manager)

)  Add extension data to the BODYSTRUCTURE command

)  Really add the support for STARTTLS

)  Add the logic required to forbid logins outside of tls sessions

)  Build the logic to handle multiple simultaneous access properly

)  Use epoll for the thread pooling instead of select

)  Create a mailstore for maildir under unix

)  Create a mailstore for an as-yet undesigned database-backend, maybe with a user class.

)  Add support for the periodic wakeup of each session to check for changes to its selected mailstore

)  Add support for the IDLE command

)  Keep some sort of track about the number of connections a user has.  Maybe
  collect some state about each user in the IMAP server

)  Pluggable modules for mail stores

)  Configuration
