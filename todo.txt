done)  Finish the login code (so that it actually checks the password)

done)  Add case insensitivity where I've deferred it

done)  Add the AUTHENTICATE code

done)  Add the stubbed-out STARTTLS code

done)  Create the mailbox manipulation parts of an initial mailstore (mbox under
  unix)

done)  Un-comment the creation of the inbox

done) Make the mailbox error text come from the mailbox classes.  This will
  include having some sort of IMAP error code that indicates a mailbox error
  and some place to hold the mailbox error code

done)  Basic name space implementation

done)  Do the commands available in both the AUTHENTICATED and SELECTED state
  (NAMESPACE through SUBSCRIBE)
  done) namespace
  done) select and examine
  done) status
  done) append

done)  Do the commands available in the SELECTED state
  done) check
  done) close
  done) expunge
  done) search
  done) fetch
  done) store
  done) copy
  done) uid (three commands)

done)  Fix the fact that copying the torture test message to another mailbox
  corrupts it.  Two questions need answering:
    done)  Why does a copy cause the currently opened mailbox to be updated?
    done)  Why is part of the line copied over itself?
      NOTE:  These are two separate problems.  I can cause the corruption by causing the
             file to be rewritten by (for example) setting and then resetting a flag.

done)  Fix expunging the torture test from foo in the mbox mail store

done)  Figure out why I get the "INBOX already subscribed dialog" in Evolution
  subtask - DONE:  Fix the logging proxy to handle sockets better and do multiple simultaneous connections in a sane fashion
  I think it has to do with the override server namespace option.
  DEFINITELY has to do with the override server namespace option.  It's supposed to do that because it's looking in the overridden namespace for
  "INBOX" and not seeing it, so it tries to subscribe to it.  This is a brain-o.

done)  Figure out why Evolution can't fetch the torture test
  I also can't fetch message 4769 from Mail/challenger498 because "fetch 4769 body.peek[header]" returns no data at all.
  Assume it's the same thing because that would be so convenient.  It was the same thing, the body[header] wasn't working

done)  Figure out what problem mutt has with AUTHENTICATE=PLAIN

done)  Properly handle the situation where the IMAP-specific headers aren't in the messages of an mbox message base.

done)  Fix the case where I try a select before login and it crashes

done)  Refactor the utility message creation in MailstoreMbox

done)  Finish the parts of the NOOP command I've deferred

done)  Asynchonous notifications.  An asynchronous notification is where the client is notified when a command is in progress, and not
  just when a noop, expunge, or check is in progress.  To do this, I need to add some mechanism for the front end to ask the back end
  about updates, and I need to have some mechanism in the front end for getting those updates for pushing to the client.

done)  Change the "DeltaqueueCheckMailbox" class to "DeltaQueueAsynchronousAction" class

done)  Fix the Support for mbox mailstores to add extra linefeeds before the "From " lines.

done)  Fix the "00000" in the time zone.

done)  Fix the "UNSEEN 1" display where there are no unseen messages.

done)  Fix the multiple simultaneous connection problem

done)  Fix the current memory leaks

done)  Make sure that the MailStoreMbox (which is actually a driver for mboxrd)
   strips off the last line in the folder

done)  Make sure that the MailStoreMbox (which is actually a driver for mboxrd)
   appends a newline to every message.

29)  Change the mail store logic so that each session has it's own list of available messages
   and so that the messages aren't purged until all sessions that are accessing a mailbox have
   been notified that the messages are going to be purged.

31)  Fix the UIDNEXT of "select inbox" is 1 should be at least 5

30)  Move the body search and text search (largely) into the MailStore class.

)  ImapServer::GetFQDN

)  Configurable invalid login delay

)  Throw exception for failures in ImapServer::ImapServer

)  Configurable home directory location

)  Locking for multiple simultaneous access to mbox mailboxes.  (flock, lockf,
  dot lock)

)  LMTP support for local deliveries

done)  Figure out how to not have SocketBindErrorException

)  Restore the rest of the SASL authentication modes.  Include varying the CAPABILITY string if the user base has plaintext passwords or not.

)  Update the CAPABILITY code to handle the SASL authentication methods for
    those user bases for which plain text passwords are available

)  Test the SASL authentication modes

)  Overwrite the strings that hold passwords

)  Handle search charsets other than US-ASCII

)  Re-do the boyer-moore-pratt search so it's not downloaded code

)  Add anonymous authentication to the capability string (availability should be known by the server class--make that so as well)

)  Deal with logging

done)  Add an idle timer

)  Add support user-defined flags to the initial mailstore

done)  Add support for a delay after a failed login (need a timer manager)

)  Add extension data to the BODYSTRUCTURE command

)  Really add the support for STARTTLS

)  Add the logic required to forbid logins outside of tls sessions

)  Build the logic to handle multiple simultaneous access properly

)  Use epoll for the thread pooling instead of select

)  Create a mailstore for maildir under unix

)  Create a mailstore for an as-yet undesigned database-backend, maybe with a user class.

)  Create a MailStoreMboxo mail store for compatability with Postfix

)  Add support for the IDLE command.  Including the code that causes it to send out
  updates if the asynchronous update notices an update while idle.

)  Keep some sort of track about the number of connections a user has.  Maybe
  collect some state about each user in the IMAP server

)  Pluggable modules for mail stores

)  Configuration

)  profiling runs, memory leaks, etc.
