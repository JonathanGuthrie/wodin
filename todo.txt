done)  Finish the login code (so that it actually checks the password)

done)  Add case insensitivity where I've deferred it

done)  Add the AUTHENTICATE code

done)  Add the stubbed-out STARTTLS code

done)  Create the mailbox manipulation parts of an initial mailstore (mbox under
  unix)

done)  Un-comment the creation of the inbox

done) Make the mailbox error text come from the mailbox classes.  This will
  include having some sort of IMAP error code that indicates a mailbox error
  and some place to hold the mailbox error code

8)  Basic name space implementation

9)  Do the commands available in both the AUTHENTICATED and SELECTED state
  (NAMESPACE through SUBSCRIBE) (namespace, select, examine, status, append)

10)  Refactor the utility message creation in MailstoreMbox

12)  Do the commands available in the SELECTED state

12)  Finish the parts of the NOOP command I've deferred

13)  Asynchonous notifications

)  Locking for multiple simultaneous access to mailboxes

)  Restore the rest of the SASL authentication modes

)  Update the CAPABILITY code to handle the SASL authentication methods for
    those user bases for which plain text passwords are available

)  Test the SASL authentication modes

)  Overwrite the strings that hold passwords

)  Re-do the boyer-moore-pratt search so it's not downloaded code

)  Add anonymous authentication to the capability string (availability should be known by the server class)

)  Deal with logging

done)  Add an idle timer

)  Add support user-defined flags to the initial mailstore

done)  Add support for a delay after a failed login (need a timer manager)
 
)  Really add the support for STARTTLS

)  Add the logic required to forbid logins outside of tls sessions

)  Build the logic to handle multiple simultaneous access properly

)  Use epoll for the thread pooling instead of select

)  Create a mailstore for maildir under unix

)  Create a mailstore for an as-yet undesigned database-backend, maybe with a user class.

)  Add support for the periodic wakeup of each session to check for changes to its selected mailstore

)  Add support for the IDLE command

)  Keep some sort of track about the number of connections a user has.  Maybe
  collect some state about each user in the IMAP server

)  Pluggable modules for mail stores 

)  Configuration
